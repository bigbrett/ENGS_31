  Number of 4 input LUTs:               453 out of   1,920   23%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            331 out of     960   34%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     331 out of     331 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     331   0%

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 47 out of      83   56%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                3 out of       4   75%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.43

Peak Memory Usage:  272 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
